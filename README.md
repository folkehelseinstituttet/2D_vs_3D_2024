#Abstract

The safety and developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) potential of chemicals remain critically understudied due to limitations of current in vivo testing guidelines, which are low throughput, resource-intensive, and hindered by species differences that limit their relevance to human health. To address these issues, robust New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) using deeply characterized cell models are essential. This study presents the comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of two advanced human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived models: a 2D adherent and a 3D neurosphere model of human neural progenitor cells (hiNPCs) differentiated up to 21 days. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we compared gene expression profiles of 2D and 3D models at three developmental stages (3, 14, and 21 days of differentiation). Both models exhibit maturation towards post-mitotic neurons, with the 3D model maturing faster and showing a higher prevalence of GABAergic neurons, while the 2D model is enriched with glutamatergic neurons. Both models demonstrate broad applicability domains, including excitatory and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, and key endocrine and especially the understudied cholinergic receptors. Comparison with human fetal brain samples confirms their physiological relevance. This study provides novel in-depth applicability insights into the temporal and dimensional aspects of hiPSC-derived neural models for DNT testing. The complementary use of these two models is highlighted: the 2D model excels in synaptogenesis assessment, while the 3D model is particularly suited for neural network formation as observed as well in previous functional studies with these models. This research marks a significant advancement in developing human-relevant, high-throughput DNT assays for regulatory purposes.
